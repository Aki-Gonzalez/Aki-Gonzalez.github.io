                    You better be careful, or this act of kindness might be your last.

                    The final game project of the second year at The Game Assembly.<br>
                    Made in <a href="ironwrought.html">IronWrought</a>, an engine developed by my second year project group.
                    <br><br>
                    Responsibilities:<br>
                    Mostly a generalist, I had 2 main contributions to the project: logic and behaviour for the UI, menus and dynamic crosshair; and animation programming for the AI 
                    working alongside the animator to make sure the monster moved in ways that respected the space of the game.
                    <br> 
                    For the animation programming I used the animation state machine I wrote for the previous project, I AM, connecting it to the AI logic of the monster.
                    I scripted the interaction for when the monster grabs the player which meant locking the player in place, removing control and making them face the monster.

                    Second game project made in <a href="ironwrought.html">IronWrought</a>, an engine developed by my second year project group.
                    PhysX was added to the engine for this project and we wanted a game that centers around physics.

                    Responsibilities:<br>
                    My role in the project was as a generalist where I contributed to player movement, menus and more.<br>
                    I had full responsibility over the logic behind the HUD for the player: a healthbar and a dynamic crosshair which connected to the gravity glove to emphasize its actions.<br>
                    Wrote an event based Animation State Machine that was used by the player and the AI, which blended between given animations depending on the state of the character.

                    A debug tool for line rendering which was used to visualize colliders and NavMesh. Animation programming for the player and AI.
                    All in all I was an all-round programmer.

                    Responsibilities:<br>
                    I had responsibility over gameplay programming for various puzzle pieces, keys and locks, used for the pressure plates and braziers found in the game that were used to unlock doors and gates.
                    I put together the logic for the menus and collaborated on a state stack which I later used to handle the transitions between levels as well as menus.

                    Tool created during the specialization course at The Game Assembly. <br>
                    I wanted to build a tool that would allow my project group's level designers to create color variations for certain models, like enemies, which could possibly reduce the workload for the artists.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I chose the game Warframe as my reference for the implementation. In Warframe players can tint their warframe with a set of colors, the areas the colors
                    affect are decided using a tintmap. The tintmap is a small texture where each color channel represents a mask, if the red channel has data on a pixel a desired color will be mixed with color from the albedo map. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The tool is in-engine and uses <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> for the user interface. A model can be loaded
                    and edited using any tintmap. The model, tintmap and colors are linked through a json file.
